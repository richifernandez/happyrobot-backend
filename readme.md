# Inbound Voice Agent API

This project implements an **Inbound Voice Agent** for carrier load booking using the HappyRobot platform.  
The API handles carrier authentication, load search, negotiation, transfer to sales reps, event logging, and exposes KPIs via a metrics dashboard.

## üìñ Notes

- Carrier verification is mocked due to FMCSA API downtime.
- The transfer step simulates handoff to a sales rep rather than automatic booking.
- Dashboard KPIs can be customized to match client requirements.
